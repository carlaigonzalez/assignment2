Exploration of bias through an analysis of comments by API perspective.


After a couple minutes of using the tool I was able to identify certain biases. Last year was pretty important for twitter in the sense that they were a very present party for communication in the US elections. After many threatening and demeaning tweets from the then POTUS Trump, Twitter decided to finally limit and then block definetly his account. Many of his tweets did not directly include curse words, they had a negative tone and expressed "toxic" traits. For this particular tool, I noticed the trend of giving a higher toxic degree for expressions containg curse words, even if the statement was not indeed offensive or negative.

The results were pretty clear. Using statements with low toxicity score, I added curse words trying to not alter the connotation of the statement, the toxicity score increased greatly in all instances. My theory is that it is hard to train a system to correctly identify the meaning behind a curse word. Although in many if not most instances they do have a negative connotation, sometimes they do not.
